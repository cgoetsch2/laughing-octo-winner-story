	Once upon a time, in waters just outside the islands of Micronesia, lived a blue-ringed octopus named Octo. This ambitious cephalapod 
had big dreams of one day being the apex predator of the sea. He roamed the Pacific searching for foes to challenge, aiming to become the 
champion of underwater combat. Using his venom, tentacles, and most importantly his intellect, he bested killer whales, lionfish, groupers,
and sharks of all varieties. His legacy grew until he was crowned Winner of Sea Combat, an esteemed title given to only a true champion such as 
himself, at which point he laughed happily, having completed his life's goal.
